      		<p id="mainvid-p1">
            These interviews showcase the work that WSUV has done to improve web accessibility for its students and serve as introduction to the subject for students that donâ€™t know much about the subject.

          </h2>
			    <p id="mainvid-p2">
      			As we began researching web accessibility, we wanted to learn more about the efforts Washington State University takes to ensure every student has the access they deserve. We spoke to many people, both on and off camera, and asked them about the guidelines the school must follow and how these guidelines have changed over the years.
          </p>
          <p id="mainvid-p3">
            We would like to thank Brian Bates, Michael Dunn, Michelle Eccles, and Joe Pyles for taking the time to speak with us and for giving us valuable insight for our project.
