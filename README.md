Accessibility Website Collaboration (user-customizable UI elements)

Summary:

The main programming feat of this project was demonstrating how to create user interface elements in the form of buttons that provide font and button size customization features to website visitors. The feature is achieved using CSS variables and minimal JavaScript to change the display size of interface elements. A secondary function helps show and hide a drawer that hides the buttons while leaving them accessible to screen readers. A tertiary feature is the skip to main content link that is the first element in the tab order and is hidden till tabbed to, which helps users avoid navigational elements if they want to first look at the page content.
